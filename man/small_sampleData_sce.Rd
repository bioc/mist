\title{Small Sample Single-Cell Data for Testing and Illustration}
\description{
  A small single-cell dataset for testing and illustration purposes, derived from the GEO dataset GSE121708. The data contains DNA methylation information from mouse gastrulation experiments at the single-cell level.
}
\usage{
system.file("extdata", "small_sampleData_sce.rds", package = "mist")
}
\format{
A \code{SingleCellExperiment} object containing:
\itemize{
  \item Metadata about cells and genes.
  \item DNA methylation levels across a subset of genes and cells.
}
}
\source{
The data originates from the GEO dataset GSE121708, as described in:

\itemize{
  \item \strong{Data Processing Steps:}
  \enumerate{
    \item Annotation: Data was annotated using the mm10 reference genome.
    \item Data Cleaning: Genes expressed in less than 10\% of cells were removed, resulting in a scDNAm dataset containing 986 cells and 18,220 genes.
    \item Pseudotime Inference: Pseudotime was inferred using the default settings in Monocle3.
    \item Subsampling:
    \itemize{
      \item For illustration purposes (e.g., vignette generation), a random sample of 100 genes was selected to create \code{sampleData_sce.rds}.
      \item For unit tests and function help pages, a random sample of 5 genes was selected to create \code{small_sampleData_sce.rds}.
    }
